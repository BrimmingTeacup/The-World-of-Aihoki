# Stats

## Strength -
> Strength is going to be a straight forward type. Strength will be used for measuring a persons physical power. How hard can they swing a mace? How well can they take a blow? 

## Intelligence - 
> Intelligence is the mental capacity that increases the power of abilities. Note, that higher Intelligence allows harder hits, but may also result in less stability, or accuracy. This will also help increase your maximum amount of Flow. 

## Control - 
> Control is magical dexterity. This is the ability to curve your spells, or increase the stability of more powerful things. Control is often used for more rogue like casters. 

## Dexterity - 
> Dexterity is the measure of how agile a character is. This helps with controlling attacks, accuracy and speed. This does NOT help the accuracy of Aether spells. 

## Mind - 
> Mind is your capability of resisting magical offenses. This includes all Primal magic, and most non-Primal, including Gravity, Monster and Arcana. This does not help with sources of non-magical conditionals, such as illness and fatigue. 

## Constitution - 
> Constitution is the physical fortitude of the character. This calculate how much health they have, and benefits their resistance of most non-magical conditionals, such as extreme heat, poison, illness, fatigue, etc. 

## Charisma - 
> Charisma increases your chance to get the bitches. 

# Starting Stats

## Base -
> Everyone, before racial bonuses, will be starting at a base of 10 for each stat. 
>> Strength: 10
>
>> Intelligence: 10
>
>> Control: 10
>
>> Dexterity: 10
>
>> Mind: 10
>
>> Constitution: 10
>
>> Charisma: 10

> To be able to increase your individual stats, you will need stat points. EXCEPT for when you first start playing. When you create a character, you will roll 4 6 sided dice, and cut the lowest of the 3. The sum of the three highest dice, or the base 10, will be what you start with, depending on which is higher. If you get a number lower than 10, you may still accept the number, and gain X many stat points where X equals 10 minus the roll. It is up to GM discretion if players are allowed to subtract naturally away from base stats, to give the character a weakness, and use those points to apply to other stats. 
> Please be aware that you may NOT subtract from any stats that are higher than 10.

>Example
>> Greg the Goblin has a 12 in his strength, a 10 in his dexterity, and an 11 in his Charisma. Greg may subtract as many points as he wishes from his Dexterity as it equals or is below 10, and add them to his other stats, so he takes 2 points from dexterity (resulting in an 8) and applies them to his strength (resulting in a 14). Greg, however, may NOT subtract from his Charisma as it is above the base 10 points.

> It is worth mentioning now that while you can have stats below the base, it is deemed unwise to take too many points out, as you will begin to have negatives affect you. Someone with a 10 in strength may not be able to lift boulders, but can still do basic functions. Someone with a 4 in strength, however, may have issues carrying small objects. Someone with a low constitution will get winded more easily, or is more likely to get sick. Be smart about this, and don't hurt your character too much. Having weaknesses makes an interesting character. Being useless to the party isn't interesting.
