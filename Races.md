Races

Humans 

Rather stereotypical. The original race of the planet, but they are not aware of it after the sundering. They were one of the first kingdoms to rise once again. 

Elves - In the world, there are streams of aether, which flow through the air, being considered as crucial as all other elements. Often called the veins of the planet. Elves were created after the first and second sundering, as the physical manifestation of specific types of aether, the first being created through a mixture of an overabundance of aether flowing out of the streams, and heightened evolution thanks to high concentrates of magical radiation.
* Light Elves
    * ~~Gremlin looking ass mother fuckers~~
    * They actually are one of the few with aether that naturally cannot use it. They bare long limbs, no hair, gaunt faces and frail bodies. Forced to live underground, these blind creatures were created after the second sundering, they are proof that evolution is not always good. 
* Dark Elves
    * The second race of elves to ever come to life, an evolved version of Arcana Elves, being capable of better usage of their aether than the Arcana Elves, and soon used this to try and over throw the Arcana Elf rulers. During the second sundering, brought by the Arcana Elves, they were heavily radiated from a magical explosion, being forced to hide underground for 100 years, to avoid the air that became toxic to them. 
* Electric Elves
    * The concentration of electric aether, born during the second sundering, these creatures, along with the desert elves, brought the First Techno-Aether revolution. Creating the first ever airships, these Elves, while frail, make up for their weaker body for their brilliant minds to infuse Aether into technology. 
* Fire Elves
    * Fire elves live a life of war, being born during the second Sundering, near the insectkin that ran rampant through the jungles, who sought nothing more than to force Fire elves to join their hive mind. This has been a war going on for 800 years, and to this day, while many fire elves have abandoned their homes in the jungles to the safety of the Order of the Magi, some still stay where they were born, and fight tooth and claw to protect their home. 
* Water Elves
    * An odd race, these creatures were born mostly in the ocean, but were known to be born in lakes as well, these creatures have had a rocky relationship with everyone being friends with the fishkin and the rest of the world. Despite that, these beings have produced some of the greatest writers to walk the planet. 
* Ice Elves
    * Nomadic creatures, that roamed the northern and southern tundras. They believed more in physical strength rather than strength with their aether. They believed to rule, you must defeat the leader in hand to hand combat, whether woman or man. If you are successful, you are the leader. These beings are rich with warrior like tradition and morals. 
* Stone Elves
    * Often referred as sentient rocks, these genderless, floating structures come from rubble and boulders that break from great mountains, and reproduce simply by doing the same to their own body. Despite not understanding social cues, and the strange ways of the fleshy creatures around them, stone elves are very kind, and believe more in talking disagreements out instead of shedding blood. These beings are also known for the beautiful gems they can create and give as gifts. 
* Wind Elves
    * Extremely neutral beings that avoid political affiliations, these beings live lives of lazy luxury, not bothering to build, nor rule, nor debate. Simply more so, to pick fruits, and play pranks on beings that enter their woods. While most live this lifestyle, some have taken residence with the Earth elves, who live more druidic lifestyles, and believe they were given the task to protect the planet at all cost. Earth elves… find them annoying. 
* Arcana Elves
    * Said to be the first Elves to walk the planet. These creatures were initially users of Dark magic, until a professor desperately proposed a bomb that would release an aether blast, strong enough to wipe out all Elves outside of their planet on their hemisphere. It did not go as plan, however, as this simply caused the air to be poisonous to dark elves, forcing them to go under ground, heavily mutate the Arcana Elves, changing their body and aether flow, and causing a second sundering which gave birth to more Elves.
* Lava Elves
    * Lava Elves are a female only race, with the ability to mate with absolutely any gender or race. They lived a life of war and enslavement, as during the great Kouloué war, they were the only ones to save these creatures from a lifetime of slavery from the humans. While 400 years have passed by, and the creature clause protects the lava elves, they suffer massive amounts of racism, with no laws to protect them in the work force, schools often denying their kind so they may not learn how to read and write, and be able to be sold into legal slavery conditions, these beings are often forced to crime just to simply get food to put on their tables for their families. 
* Earth Elves
    * The closest to stereotypical DnD elves. These beings live in the woods, and believed they were created to protect the planet. They have strict traditions, and have stories of fairies and dwarves that are made to teach children right and wrong. 
* Desert Elves
    * One of the only beings to deny Aether. While these beings have control over fire and wind, they make it illegal for their kind to cast spells in their kingdom, as they know aether was the cause for bother sunderings. As such, they focus more so on technology, and with the electric elves, have created some of the most used inventions to this day. 
* Metal Elves
    * These were one of the first Elves to ally with the humans after the second sundering, using their great manipulation of metal to teach how to make proper armor and weapons. The metal elves would help the humans with the Kouloué war for 5 years, before having to drop out, nearly being wiped off the planet from the Ulué (the deerkin). 
* Fairies
    * Myths of beings that are created by pure concentrated aether, that has no elemental affiliation. No fire, no water, no stone, no wind, just aether. These creatures have never been seen, but stories of these creatures are told by many, mostly Earth Elves.
* Galaxa Elves
    * Not too much is known about the Galaxa elves, beings of great technological prowess that left their home, in search for a new source of aether. They’ve taken residence on the two moons of this planet, and while reluctant, often do trade and treaties with the Order of Magi. 
* Dwarves
    * Similar to the fairies, though these creatures live underground and are known for symbols of knowledge. Beings that stay underground spending their whole life reading books of all kind.

Kouloué - (Rename when you can)

* Catkin - Maikué
    * Desert dwelling cat folk, these beings believe in one idea first and foremost. Beauty. It is not the strong who rule, nor the intelligent. Not even the eldest. Rather, it is the most beautiful and the richest. Those who have money ,and those that have good looks are free from slavery, and free from the trickle down economics that run rampant in their kingdom. 
* Foxkin - Yotué
    * The most affected from the Kouloué war, these crafty beasts believe that the secret to life will be unlocked once they can live in peace all over the world. These creatures are usually the most tribal, living all over the planet in many ecosystems, simply wishing to learn more about the aether streams. 
* Fishkin - Masaué
    * Good and evil is often viewed as subjective. Masaué view themselves as good, believing that all beings were meant to most to the oceans after the second sundering. As such, all who live on land are defective, and must be purge to purify the world. The Masaué are viewed as enemies to the Order, and been declared to not be allowed any admittance to the Creature Clause, the law that allows a Grand High Magi to bless a race with protection from murder and assault of all kinds. 
* Deerkin - Ulué
    * Ulué are strangely very militaristic. They were heavily affected by the Kouloué war, almost to the point of the Yotué, but quickly evolved how wars were won, with their knowledge of guerrilla warfare, and “obscure” battle tactics. 
* Dogkin - Kayoué
    * One of the more neutral Kouloué. These pack mentality race is only part of the Order by the good grace of a Grand High Magi, who extended an invitation to the order, in hopes to learn more about their kind. While accepted, still not much is known about the creatures. 
* Bearkin - Kanlaué 
    * These beings are one of the most misunderstood Kouloué. Believed to be strong warriors, these beings have actually never been to war, even against other tribes of Kanlaué. While they have the tendency to have terrible attitudes, these beings are more focused on foreign affairs, and to show their rich culture of painters, writers and chefs. 
* Insectkin - (Still working on names)
    * While not viewed as a true enemy of the Order, insect kin are not protected by the creature clause. An invitation was extended to them once as a trade if they would end the war against the Fire Elves. The insect kin wished for peace by all joining the hive mind. As a result, they were not brought into the Order. 
        * Bee
            * Bee insectkin are the most common. Often preying on beings that wander too close to the southern Jungles, fire elves especially, these beings use honey to mind control and force people to become their mindless slaves to the great queen bee. 
        * Spider
            * A bit more selfish, these beings simply want their own personal followers, rather than the hive minds followers. Spider will use fear and poison to make people follow them. If they decline, they are eaten. 
* Horsekin - Tal-loué
    * The Tal-loué believe the strongest is determined by the hardest working. Similar to amish like lifestyles, these creatures work with little technology, to live. As such, it is extremely rare to see these beings in cities, being an almost entirely tribal race. 
* Aviankin - Litoué
    * While the Litoué don’t have many great inventors, they are massive consumers of technology. They are master tradesmen and merchants, that learned how to make great quantities of money, which have been put to created floating cities, some by aether, some by technology. These beings are also known for their great aerial combat tactics, despite never going to war. 
* Lizardkin
    * These beasts lived close to the Lava Elves, and were given sanctuary as a result from humans who wished to force them into slavery. This race is nearly extinct now, after hunters, wishing to take their scales for clothing, and are one of the few that are immune from modern slavery laws. 
* Bunnykin - Banwaué
    * Banwaué are known for their secrecy, and long line of ninjas, informants and assassins. These beings have no truly affiliation, other than whomever will pay for their services the most. 
* Bull/Cowkin - Anka-nué
    * This final race are the most similar to the lifestyle of dwarves, if Dwarves lived on the surface. They love gold, fighting, and good cheers. A rich tradition, with a philosophy that yesterdays foe can be tomorrows friend.
